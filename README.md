# React starter project

A minimal project to get started with React:

* webpack and webpack-dev-server
* ES6 and JSX via Babel 
* hot module reloading via [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)

Installation:

```
git clone git@github.com:rauschma/react-starter-project.git
cd react-starter-project
npm install
```

Thanks to `npm run`, everything is installed locally!

Development:

* Build once: `npm run webpack`
* Run dev server: `npm start`
    * Web page: http://localhost:8080/
    * Keep the console open to see errors and warnings

You can check out hot reloading by making changes to the JavaScript source code. You’ll see the results of those changes in the browser right away.

No support for testing, yet, I’m still in the process of figuring out what I want there.
